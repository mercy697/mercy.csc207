    <p>Computer Science is the study of computers and computation system.<br>Unlike electrical and computer engineers,computer scientists deal mostly with software and software systems;this include there theory,design,development,and application.</p>
    <p>Computer Science programs in Kwara State University include:

    <p>The simplest experiment to which probability applies is one with two possible outcomes. One such experiment consists of examining a single fuse to see whether it is defective. The sample space for this experiment can be abbreviated as ,, where N represents not defective, D represents defective and the curly retain their original meaning in set theory. Sample spaces are usually defined based on objective of the analysis. It is said to be discrete if it consists of a finite or countably infinite set of outcomes. It is continuous if it contains an interval (either finite or infinite) of real numbers. The simplest experiment to which probability applies is one with two possible outcomes.
